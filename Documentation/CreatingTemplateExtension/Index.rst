Creating a Template Extension
-----------------------------

If you have a TYPO3 installation using TemplaVoilà! Plus already you can just use the migration
wizard.

If you want to create a new extension or sitepackage which supplies a TVP template or if you need
a reference you can refer to the
`Demo Theme for TYPO3 TemplaVoilà! Plus v8+ <https://github.com/extrameile/em_tvplus_theme_demo>`_
for the time being.
